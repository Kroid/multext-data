The word-form lexica are in MULTEXT format, where each entry is in a
separate line and contains (at least) three fields; the first filed of
the entry is the word-form, the second the lemma, and the third the
morphosyntactic description, MSD. Some lexica also make use of further
columns, e.g. Persian gives the transliteration to ASCII of the
word-form and lemma.

The files are encoded in UTF-8 with TAB (^I) as record separator and
Unix-type end-of-lines (^J). Sort order is UTF-8. When the word-form 
or lemma contains spaces, these are substituted by underscore.

The MSD are defined in the MULTEXT-East morphosyntactic
specifications, http://nl.ijs.si/ME/V4/msd/
Note that the lexica use the definitions for the particular language, 
not the common ones.
